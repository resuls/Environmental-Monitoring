# Socket
Implementing a client-server communication using sockets.

## Running the C++ server:
Compile tcpserver.cpp file and execute it on command line as:
`tcpserver <port_number>`

## Running the C++ client:
Compile tcpclient.cpp file and execute it on command line as:
`tcpclient <port_number> <server_ip>`

## Running the Java client:
Edit the IP address and the port because I didn't add the command line interface.
Run the Java file.
